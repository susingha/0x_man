char devices:
    can be read as steam of bytes like a file
    on most char devices u cant move back n forth unlike regular files (there are exceptions)
    impements open, close, read, write system calls


list_head -> pointer to head of linked list.
hlist_node -> hash list of the linked list.


threads:
http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/05-threads.html
difference between userlevel and kernel level threads:
user level thread makes a system call and blocks, the whole process (all threads) gets blocked.
	cannot make advantage of multiple processors or hyperthreading architectures

	But userlevel threads doesnt need to switch to kernel for a thread switch,
	hence light weight than kernel threads.
	Each process has its own version of scheduler, hence can be optimized according to
	per process needs rather than replying on a generic kernel version
	More portable across architectures cuz dependency is on threading library not on system calls
kernel level thread makes a system call, the kernel switches thread context and process is not blocked.
	Hence use a good combination of user and kernel level threads together

whats is hyper threading (intel) ?
tasks are scheduled parallely instead of one after the other delimited by a scheduler each time
one processor picking tasks from two queues instead of one hence reducing waiting times
lay man explaination: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hyperthreading-technology-explained/


interrupt handler:
http://www.itechtalk.com/thread239.html
it generally wakes up sleeping processes waiting for some event on this device/fd
it cannot copy data to/from user space because it doesnt execute in the context of a process
should not sleep (call wait_event, etc)
should not call schedule
should not allocate memory with anything other than GFP_ATOMIC. or lock a semaphone.
in other words, it should be as atomic as possible.
ISRs has been kept out of process contexts for purely DESIGN DECISIONS. its not fundamentally impossible.
check: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1053572/why-kernel-code-thread-executing-in-interrupt-context-cannot-sleep
       http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.kernelnewbies/1783
the void* that you pass during request_irq is passed back to you as call back data when the handler is called.
also same interrupt handler can be registered for more than one IRQs. as in tj_8321 driver.
implemented using top half and bottom half. bottom half implemented using tasklet, workqueue
struct pt_regs *regs gives you a 'snapahot of the processors context' before entering the handler, which you can debug (how ??)

interrupt handlers cannot leave the processor, cannot sleep, cannot call schedule or other sleepy functions, cannot do io, 
	  all of that means the same thing, they cannot leave the processor, cuz they cannot be scheduled back
	  cuz they dont have a process context
be careful when:
        behave like in atomic context. check common code with in_atomic() or preferably in_interrupt()
        https://lwn.net/Articles/274695/
	allocating memory: GFP_ATOMIC only
	locking: cannot use mutexes / semaphores, Only spinlocks if you must. Dont lock the same spinlock twice, else deadlock
	transfers: no IO, no userspace copy paste, the page access might result in a page fault (sleep)
	functions: no schedule, no kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL), no input_register_device(). use in_interrupt() to check interrupt context
	reentrant: not required. when ISR is executing, its IRQ is disabled. Hence return ASAP so you dont miss an interrupt
	           fast handlers run with all IRQs disabled. fast handlers better is really Fast
        use tasklets or work queues for bottom halves

	tasklet:
	never runs parallel to itself. should not also run parallely with the interrupt handler.
	this should be handled with proper locking between the tasklet and interrupt handler

Q: can a interrupt handler be preemted ?? only by a higher priority ISR, provided our ISR has not been marked as a fast handler


Locking:
stupid ways to mutual exclusion: local_irq_save(flags), local_irq_restore(flags). use semaphore locking

spin locks are much faster then mutex locks (about a 100 cpu cycles). spin locks used for protection to smaller computations
apply locks in as much smaller granularity as possible. as in not lock the whole OS for the sake of protecting a variable

File Systems:
dentries point to inode. inode also points back to dentry. its a list head. this list will have pointers to only those dentries that have been accessed, or rather those that has been cached and NOT ALL hardlinks files

inodes have a i_private pointer for custom purposes.

Reading files from kernel space is not encouraged and is a bad practice.
	read from /proc ? No procs file systems are clamped down by kernel developers cuz
	they began to be abused by programmers to store almost any type of data. procs are 
	more encouraged to contain mostly process related data.
	passing data by ioctls ? converting data passed by 32 bit programs to a 64 bit running kernel are dangerous.
	configuration files: use sysfs. how to create a sysfs ?? http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8110




some kernel programming guidelines
http://linuxinme.blogspot.com/2007/05/allocating-memory-in-kernel.html
http://www.careercup.com/question?id=15037854 <-- why do we need copy_from_user / copy_to_user

buffer overflow: http://cprogramming.com/tutorial/secure.html

kernel panics are of two types:
soft panic: oops (same as segfaults in a user program)
hard panic: Aieee (is nothing but oops while you are in an isr)

if an stackdump occurs its the EIP to look for.
it says the function name and module name at the time of the oops/aieee

fork and vfork
fyi: fork is implemented using copy-on-write pages.
i.e. the pages are copied to new pages only when the parent/child attempts to modify its own pages.
until then the child also uses the parent's pages


TODO:
mode switch and context switch. what exactly happens
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2479118/cpu-switches-from-user-mode-to-kernel-mode-what-exactly-does-it-do-how-does-it
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/11sp-w4118/lectures/trap.pdf
important steps:
- transition must be done in secure way
- initiated by trap interrupt.
- save process state so it can be resumed later. stack, processor registers
- start executing the interrupt (trap) handler


how large is the kernel executable size. is it normally more than what is allocated for the kernel in the RAM.
how much stack size and heap size is given to a normal user executable in the physical memory and/or virtual memory.
per process information maintained by the kernel: only task_struct
tasklets are run in interrupt context and work-queues are run in process context. means ?? how ??


Memory:
why NULL pointer cannot be accessed. 0 should be a valid virtual memory address
first page in a process is never mapped. design decision
(so that dereferencing a NULL pointer fails cleanly rather than unintendedly accessing actual memory)

http://users.nccs.gov/~fwang2/linux/lk_addressing.txt (or check lk_addressing.txt in this folder)

TLB, process tags, page tables

struct task_struct is nothing but the PCB

some terms related to virtual to physical address translation:
TLB hit, TLB miss
TLB is implemented as a Content Addresseable Memory
in case of a TLB miss, we go for a page walk and fill in the TLB.
if page walk fails, it raises a page fault. and the requested virtual address is loaded to the memory from HD and new page tables are setup (swap out may/maynot happen) and TLB is filled again
in case of a context switch from process to process, the TLB is flushed.
in case of a context switch from thread to thread of a process the TLB is NOT flushed. this is not a context switch at all

how is a fork bomb cured in linux kernel:
the runtime priority is divided between the parent and child on every fork. hence both suffers on a fork.
other processes keep running smoothly (but only till the priorities are recalculated)


copying data between userspace and kernel space.
make sure that you are not transferring any space specific pointers across space.
a kernel pointer would not be understood in user space and vice versa <<-- ?? why !



How to become a daemon:
=======================
dissociate from tty
become session and process group leader
go to background by fork off and die
change current directory to /
change umask
close all open fds inherited from parent. including 0, 1, 2. open fds later as needed
use a log file for outputs/error

whats a futex (fast userspace mutex) in linux
WAIT(addr, val) and
WAKE(addr, val)




procs:
/proc/pid_of_process/maps, the kernel is simply going through the linked list of VMAs (vm_area_struct) for the process and printing each one.
or check pmap <pid>        VMAs are stored both as a linked list (for printing) and as red black trees (for searching virtual addresses)
                           the vm_area_struct linked list are rooted at the task_struct->mm_struct->mmap field
                           the vm_area_struct re black trees are rooted at the task_struct->mm_struct->mm_rb field
			   the page table entry (PTE) linked list are also rooted at the task_struct->mm_struct->pgd field
			   the first bit of the PTE is the Present bit which if 0 raises a page fault
/proc/pid_of_process/mem, should show the mapped memory of a process, but one process cannot read the memory of another process
                          so this proc normally prints No such process
			  but /proc/self/mem should work, why IO error ?? cuz the mem is not mapped just like NULL !
/proc/buddyinfo, prints how many blocks of each order are available for each memory zone on the system.
                 but which column is of which order pages ??
/proc/interrupts, prints how many interrupts arrived on which IRQ on which processor
/proc/modueles, prints all the insmodded modules and their major numbers, minor numbers and dependencies
