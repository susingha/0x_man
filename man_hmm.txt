Technical Skills:
# have a global search portal. this should search:
	bugs, TAC cases
	technical mail conversations (cc to emailin@cisco.com updates the wiki automatically)
# have a daily build server which shall keep source codes and builds ready to be downloaded any time, impromptu
# unitests: each function should have a meaning and purpose.
  There should be a UT to test that purpose with good code coverage of the function.
  UT should be a part of build systems or atleast pre checkin requirement.
# somethime like test platform debugger to call certain functions out of the blue on a running system.
  this could be used to change globals and other system wide variables.
# something to be able to insert code. this is tricky. need deep linux and linker funda
# logging mechanish. both local and remote
# Pre checkin code analyzer or guidelines in code reviews:
	As many lines of comments as the function itself or more. Conforms with the UT of that function.
	Promote inline comments with //
	Not too large functions
	use spaces intead of tabs (.vimrc)
# Any rule (code guideline or commit requirements) can be overrides but should be able to be tracked.

Managerial Skills:
# Managers are not superior to devleopers and are paid the same.
# Managers sit in cubes. Technical leads sit in cabins
# Managers / Directors / CEOs dont send emails to developers if first person (NEVER)
  Managers can instruct a developer (new joiners) to send an emai about guidelines or any other business information.
  The general vibe should be that developers run the company. Not managers.
# Open work space. Cubes are self setup. PCs are self installed. True Startup culture.
# Tech leads must understand business. Tech leads teach business to developers.
  Conversations like: If we dont complete this by this time, we lose that customer and we lose that amount of money.
# Discourage jargons: Ground level talks and no jargons.

Logistics:
# Phone > Chat > Email. Generally a more live mode of conversation gets more priority
# Open work space. Cubes are self setup. PCs are self installed. True Startup culture.
# Free food (breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner)
# Incentives / Recognitions to use of public transport instead of car / bike.
# WFH, VPN, Laptops, Monitors, Equipments unlimited. You can bring your own device. Any device.
  You can take home devices if you want but with records. No permission needed.
